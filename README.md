# Dotfiles!

More details on the respective theme folders, but in general:

The themes are wrapped around my colorscheme manager [colorer](https://github.com/kiddae/colorer).

To install the themes,

+ make sure you have installed `colorer`.
+ copy/link the files to their respective location starting from the home directory (`cp -r <theme-name>/. ~`)
+ run `colorer <colorscheme-name>`, with a colorscheme from the folder `.config/colorer/coloschemes/` to generate config files in `.config/colorer/out`. They will automatically be linked/copied according to the script `commands` from `colorer`'s configuration folder.
+ tweak some stuff; some of these elements (keybinds, aliases...) are quite personal and might not fit your needs. Play around, remove what's useless and find something that suits you!

The wallpapers can be found in this mess: [wallpapers](https://github.com/kiddae/wallpapers)

This was made over my older and messier dotfiles repository that you can still access on the `old` branch.
